# HGV: Hierarchical Global Views-guided Sequential Representation Learning for Risk Prediction

This repository is the implementation of the paper entitled as HGV: Hierarchical Global Views-guided Sequential Representation Learning for Risk Prediction.

![Graphical illustration of hierarchical global views-guided sequential representation learning for risk prediction. This figure is composed of three parts. The left part shows the workflow of how to obtain clips-aware sequential representation from heterogeneity among snapshots in instance-level with the proposed Global Graph Embedding (GGE) module. The right part shows the learning process of an adaptive trade-off between time interval and variables significance with Global Adaptive Decay-Attention ($\beta$-Attn) and LSTMs from the individualized sequential signal in channel-level. The top part shows the feature-dependencies modeling between the global guidance learned by GGE and other channel-wise signal information.](https://github.com/LiYouru0228/HGV/blob/main/framework.jpg?raw=true)
